# What is KDM?
Monster is cooperative game for up to 4 players. Play survivors ekeing out an existence in the overwhelming darkness. Your story unfolds in a campaign that is played over many nights at the game table or ends quickly in bitter defeat. Every decision matters. Every space moved, every resource spent, every governing principle chosen - all have lasting impact on this highly replayable and challenging game.

# What is this project?
This game is heavy and my players would like a more streamlined experience. This project aims at providing that as well a QoL improvements for the game. This is for personal use only, I don't own any of the rights to any of the content in this project

# How do I use it?
This will be documented better once we have application v1 running. I am currently working on tickets to complete this.
