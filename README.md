KDM, or Kingdom Death Monster, is a tabletop strategy game where surviors hunt monsters to help keep their settlement alive while also defending themselves from the horrors that attack them.

It is a complicated game, and it's often joked that it's more of a paper keeping activty over a board game experience. While some like this, including myself, my playgroup has desired a more streamlined way to play the game, so we are developing a webapp for person use
