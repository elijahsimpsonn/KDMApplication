# What is KDM?
Monster is cooperative game for up to 4 players. Play survivors ekeing out an existence in the overwhelming darkness. Your story unfolds in a campaign that is played over many nights at the game table or ends quickly in bitter defeat. Every decision matters. Every space moved, every resource spent, every governing principle chosen - all have lasting impact on this highly replayable and challenging game.

# What is this project?
This game is heavy and my players would like a more streamlined experience. This project aims at providing that as well a QoL improvements for the game. This is for personal use only, I don't own any of the rights to any of the content in this project

# How do I use it?
Currently the project MVP is being worked on, starting with the large task of creating a complex relational database in SQlite and populating the game data, as well as logic to define certain game systems. We will then be working on the web application itself which will also take some time since we have goal to make this a very enjoyable user experience
